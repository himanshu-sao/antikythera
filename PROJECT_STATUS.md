## ⏳ Technical Gaps & Pending Tasks

### Automation Studio
- [ ] **UI Placeholders**: Implement "Add Context", "Use Variable", and "Examples" buttons.
- [ ] **Integration**: Wire up "Compose Instruction" to call Jira adapter with JQL.
- [ ] **Validation**: Add unit/integration tests for new endpoints and UI components.

### General System Gaps
- [ ] **Backend**: Complete implementation of variable handling and context addition.
- [ ] **Stability**: Ensure all `SESSIONS_UPDATE.md` entries are synchronized with the actual state.

## 🧪 Verification & Test Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- Test individual hooks in isolation.
- Test pure functions and utilities.
- Test component rendering with different props.

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test component interactions.
- Test API integration points.
- Test state management flows.

### 3. UI/Functional Tests
- Test user interactions (drag/drop, clicks, form submissions).
- Test responsive behavior.
- Test accessibility features.

### 4. End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user workflows.
- Test error scenarios.
- Test loading states.

## 🤖 AI Agent Protocol
When resolving issues from this document:
1. **Update Documentation**: Update `README.md` and design docs to reflect new behavior. Do not use changelogs; update the descriptions.
2. **Cleanup**: Remove the checklist entry once resolved and verified.
3. **Testing**: Move resolved items to a `Needs Testing` state with exact test commands and expected outputs.
4. **Environment**: Always use the Python virtual environment and `start_antikythera.sh` / `stop_antikythera.sh`.
