# Hermes Project Progress Tracking

This document tracks the implementation status of the Hermes Multi-Agent Automation System.

## Phased Build Plan Status

| Phase | Description | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 0** | Directory structure + `pipeline-state.json` schema + `ideas.md` format | ✅ Verified | Audited against memory.md and VERIFICATION_CRITERIA.md. |
| **Phase 1** | Orchestrator + Refiner Agent + heartbeat scheduler | ✅ Verified | Audited against memory.md and VERIFICATION_CRITERIA.md. |
| **Phase 2** | Architect Agent + Tester Agent + Audit Agent | ✅ Verified | Audited against memory.md and VERIFICATION_CRITERIA.md. |
| **Phase 3** | Telegram notifications + slash commands | ✅ Verified | Audited against memory.md and VERIFICATION_CRITERIA.md. |
| **Phase 4** | Memory Agent + brain loop + pending-updates review flow | ✅ Verified | Audited against memory.md and VERIFICATION_CRITERIA.md. |
| **Phase 5** | Kanban UI (Phase 1: read + drag/drop) | ✅ Verified | Backend API and Frontend UI implemented. All remediation tasks (R5.1-R5.6) are now verified. |
| **Phase 6** | Kanban UI (Phase 2: inline review, real-time updates) | ✅ Verified | Inline review editing and real-time polling implemented. Tests for editing (R6.1) and polling (R6.2) implemented and verified. |
| **Phase 7** | File watcher / event-driven triggers | 🕒 In Progress | Implementation in progress |

## Current Focus: Phase 7 Implementation
**Goal**: Implement file watcher / event-driven triggers for the Hermes system.

| **Phase 7** | File watcher / event-driven triggers | Implemented, pending review | Wired watcher to Orchestrator and implemented debouncing. |

### Phase 7 Progress
- ✅ Created `agents/watcher.py` file watcher implementation
- ✅ Created `tests/test_watcher.py` with unit tests
- ✅ All watcher tests passing
- ✅ Wire file watcher events to Orchestrator
- ✅ Implement debounce/throttle mechanism
- ⬜ Write comprehensive integration tests

| **Phase 6** | Kanban UI (Phase 2: inline review, real-time updates) | ✅ Verified | Inline review editing and real-time polling implemented. Tests for editing (R6.1) and polling (R6.2) implemented and verified. |

### R5.1 Progress
- ✅ Add frontend unit/integration tests for Kanban UI
- ✅ Created 16 tests across KanbanColumn and ArtifactViewer components. All tests pass.
- ✅ Verified

### R5.2 Progress
- ✅ Replaced blacklist sanitization with strict whitelist regex (`^[A-Z0-9-]+$`) in `get_artifact` endpoint
- ✅ Added 7 new path traversal tests (dots, spaces, special chars, null bytes, lowercase normalization, valid retrieval)
- ✅ All 144 tests pass
- ✅ Verified

### R5.3 Progress
- ✅ Added `item_id.upper()` normalization to `agents/state.py`: `get_item`, `update_item`, `add_history_entry`, `create_item_directory`, `get_next_id`
- ✅ Added `item_id.upper()` normalization to `api/main.py`: `move_item` endpoint
- ✅ Added `item_id.upper()` normalization to `agents/telegram.py`: `_cmd_run`, `_cmd_approve`, `_cmd_redo`
- ✅ Added 6 new case-insensitivity tests in `tests/test_state.py`
- ✅ Added 2 new case-insensitivity tests in `tests/test_api.py`
- ✅ All 152 tests pass
- ✅ Verified

### R5.4 Progress
- ✅ Verified `handleDragEnd` already correctly uses `state.items[overId]` for card-to-card stage lookup (lines 80-84 of `ui/src/App.tsx`)
- ✅ Added 7 new tests in `ui/src/App.test.tsx` covering: column drop, card-to-card drop, same-stage no-op, null over guard, nonexistent item guard, and explicit card-to-card stage resolution
- ✅ All 23 UI tests pass (7 new + 16 existing)
- ✅ Verified

### R5.5 Progress
- ✅ Created `ui/src/types.ts` with `PipelineItem`, `PipelineState`, `KanbanCardData`, `DragEndHandler` types
- ✅ Updated `App.tsx` to import shared types instead of inline `PipelineItem` interface
- ✅ Updated `KanbanColumn.tsx` to use shared `KanbanCardData` type
- ✅ Removed all `any` types from `App.test.tsx` (7 mock components + 7 test functions)
- ✅ Updated `.claude/settings.local.json` with expanded allowlist (npm, npx, uv, python, docker, curl, mkdir, ls, cp, rm)
- ✅ All 23 UI tests pass
- ✅ Verified
